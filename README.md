# Backbrewner Café Website

## Project Overview
This website was developed by students from the College of Science at the Technological University of the Philippines as part of their Web Development course (CC311L-M | CC312-M). It serves as a digital platform for "Backbrewner Café," a coffee shop inspired by music, warmth, and emotion. The project transitions theoretical concepts into a hands-on application, engineering a complete multi-page environment to capture the cozy atmosphere of a physical coffee shop in a digital space.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide an online presence for Backbrewner Café to improve brand visibility and reach a wider audience. Specifically, the website aims to:
* Showcase the café's menu (Drinks, Foods, and Products) and featured items.
* Provide an aesthetic and engaging user experience that mirrors the warmth of the café.
* Allow users to easily contact the café for inquiries and feedback.
* Offer a responsive design that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
