# Backbrewner Café Website

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This website was developed by students from the College of Science at the Technological University of the Philippines as part of their Web Development course (CC311L-M | CC312-M)[cite: 1, 9, 10]. [cite_start]It serves as a digital platform for "Backbrewner Café," a coffee shop inspired by music, warmth, and emotion[cite: 12, 443]. [cite_start]The project transitions theoretical concepts into a hands-on application, engineering a complete multi-page environment to capture the cozy atmosphere of a physical coffee shop in a digital space[cite: 676, 681].

## Purpose
[cite_start]The primary purpose of this project is to provide an online presence for Backbrewner Café to improve brand visibility and reach a wider audience[cite: 67, 68]. Specifically, the website aims to:
* [cite_start]Showcase the café's menu (Drinks, Foods, and Products) and featured items[cite: 59, 60, 128].
* [cite_start]Provide an aesthetic and engaging user experience that mirrors the warmth of the café[cite: 55, 62].
* [cite_start]Allow users to easily contact the café for inquiries and feedback[cite: 65, 66].
* [cite_start]Offer a responsive design that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices[cite: 70, 71].
